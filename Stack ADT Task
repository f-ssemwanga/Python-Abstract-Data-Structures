Use the code below to implement the stack and perform the tasks underneath.  Add evidence of your coded  solution below this code.

#Stack implementation using a list in OOP

class Stack:

    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = list()

    #Adding elements to stack
    def push(self,data):
        #Checking to avoid duplicate entries
        #append the new data Item to the stack
        #return True if the append was successful otherwise return False

    #Removing the last element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        #check if the stack is not empty before removing an item
        #return "stack is empty" or return the removed item
    #Getting the size of the stack
    def size(self):
        #return the length of the stack
    #Add an extra method to display the contents of the stack

#Tasks:
    #Create an instance of the stack
    #push these values in the correct order [5,6,9,6,3]
    #perform an operation to check the size of the stack
    #perform 4 consecutive pop operations
    # perform an operation to check the size
    # Perform one more pop operation
