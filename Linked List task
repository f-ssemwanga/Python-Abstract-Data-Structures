Task 1: 
	- Create a Node class passing the following parameters
	To the constructor method
	(self, data =None)
	- Initialise instance variables
		self.data to data
		self.next to None

Task 2:  create the linked list class passing self to the constructor
	- Initialise the head to an instance of the Node class

Task 3: Create methods to perform operations on the list

	a) Create an append method which takes  (self, data)
		○ Create a new node
		○ Set the current node to the head node
		○ Loop until you reach the end of the list  i.e. the next node = None
		○ Add new node by setting the next node to the new node.
	b) Create getter method to return the length of the list takes (self)
		○ Create a variable to hold current node and set it to point to the head
		○ Create a variable to hold total nodes visited
		○ Loop over the list will you reach the last node
			§ Increment the total after each node
			§ Set the current node to the next node
		○ Return the total nodes visited
	c) Create a method to display the list -takes (self)
	
		○ Create an empty list to store the elements as they are being visited
		○ Create a variable to hold the current node, set it to the head node
		○ Loop over  till you reach the end of the list
			§ Set the current node to the next node
			§ Append the current data to the list of visited elements
		○ Print the list
	Create an extractor method to remove an item from the list given its index 
	Takes (self, index to remove)
		○ Check that the index given is in the range of the list
			§ If index is not in the range of the list 
				□ Print an appropriate error message
			§ Create a variable to store the current index which should be the 0 
			§ Set the current node to the head node
			§ Loop over the list (e.g. while True:)
				□ Set current node to the next node
				□ If current index is the same as the index we are looking for
					® Return data in the current node
				□ Else
					® Increment the current index by 1
			

Test your code by writing code which answers the following questions:
	1. Create an instance of the linked list
	2. Append the following data to the linked list
	Positions = [33,43,44,22,56]
	
	3. Call the display method on the linked list in 1  above to show data in the list
	4. Print  the element  at the 3rd index
	5. Write a method to search for an item in the list
Add add snips of your code  to the right of this task
